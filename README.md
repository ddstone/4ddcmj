Original
===================================

A program that help user memorise the important things which seem to be not. Such like her, who led me into coding field, but now we are apart.

That's certainly not what i want. Since the first reason i learnt how to code is to help her with CS class in university, and i'm so god damn not over her, then i decide to spend 20 hours a week on this program, in order to implement so useful program, trying to help others not to be like me xD

Happy birthday, cmj xD
